# .constrain Class
The .constrain class helps keep the section of a page and it's contents in minimum width of 1000px and also centers that section of the page so that things don't get too wide if someone tries to open it up on a Cinema tv screen (It's wierd but people do that ;)).

# Page IDs
Every page has a Unique ID. The ID is used to style everything inside the section.
There were some pages I didn't include an ID for, they weren't needed and the body ID idea came to my mind when styling became confusing so I decided to give all pages IDs so their style selectors don't clash.

# Section IDs
Every section has a Unique ID. The ID is used to style everything inside the section.
There were some cases I had to use Class instead (pages like "business-details") because those pages contain Tabs (Having 2 or more pages in one page but the pages are in Tabs).

# .h-grid & .v-grid Classes
h-grid adds a horizontal grid wherever it is used.
v-grid adds a vertical grid wherever it is used.

# .with-bottom-menu Class
This class helps to add padding-bottom to the body in a page that has a bottom menu.
The padding is very useful and it pushes up the body content so it doesn't go underneath the bottom menu.
